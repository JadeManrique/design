    <h1> I love walking and backpacking </h1>
    <p> I fell in love with backcountry backpacking in highschool. I was surrounded by a large group of various kinds of people. Loud, quiet, funny, philosophical, loving, rich, and poor. With this group of people, we backpacked the Sierra Nevada, Joshua Tree and the Lost Coast of Humboldt County. These trips changed the way I felt about being alive.  </p>
