    <h1> My Journeys </h1>
    <p> I fell in love with backcountry backpacking in highschool. I was surrounded by a large group of various kinds of people. Loud, quiet, funny, philosophical, loving, rich, and poor. With this group of people, we backpacked the Sierra Nevada, Joshua Tree and the Lost Coast of Humboldt County. These trips changed the way I felt about being alive.  </p>

    <h1> Sierra Nevada </h1>
    <p> The Sierra Nevada was my first backpacking trip. We backpacked what felt like 50 miles. I am not sure how many miles it was. There were groups of 10-12 people starting off at different trail heads meeting in the middle after the 11 day journey. </p>

    <h1> Joshua Tree </h1>
    <p> Joshua Tree was a special trip since I have been there once as a child before and had this incredible memory of the Milky Way. We went there during spring when there were tons of flowers blooming all over the desert. </p>

    <h1> The Lost Coast </h1>
    <p> The Lost Coast was the latest of my trips and was the most relaxed and easy. Simple, flat terrain but the sandy beach was harder to trudge through. </p>
